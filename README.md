📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

🔍 Why This Project?

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges in the telecom industry. Losing customers not only reduces revenue but also increases acquisition costs. Businesses often know that customers are leaving — but not why.

This project focuses on understanding customer behavior, identifying why customers churn, and providing data-driven insights that can help telecom companies retain customers more effectively.

🎯 What I Tried to Solve

1.Which customers are most likely to churn?

2.What behaviors and services increase churn risk?

3.How can businesses identify high-risk customers early?

4.What insights can help reduce customer attrition?
